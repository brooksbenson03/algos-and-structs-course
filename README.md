## Debugging

The `debugger` keyword in JavaScript makes it easy to stop a program during runtime to view the values that are floating around at that given moment.

To start up debugging in node, you can use `node inspect [filename]`, which will execute the code in debugger mode.

During debugging mode, code will halt when it hits a `debugger` statement. To continue executing after the pause, you can use the `continue` command. The `c` command is an alias for `continue`.

To inspect a variable during execution, you can use the command `repl`.

## Palindromes

A *palindrome* is a string that, when reversed, forms the same string from before it was reversed.
